### Summary

Open Source Technology Improvement Fund organized a security audit of c-ares, funded by Amazon Web Services and carried out by X41 D-Sec.

### Details

C-ares is a library written in C for asynchronous DNS requests, which runs on such applications as Microsoft Windows, Netware, and Android. It was developed at MIT, when a group expanded upon the capabilities of the ares library and licensed c-ares in 1998. 

Overall, X41 found the c-ares library to be well designed and implemented. The audit found six inconsistencies during the process. Three vulnerabilities were rated as medium, three others as informational. Alongside performing static manual code review, the X41 team implemented and customized AFL++ fuzzers during this audit. Recently, AFL++ fuzzers have been made to support command-line interface (CLI) fuzzing, which was important to this audit as c-ares is made up of multiple CLI tooling components in its code base. While the audit particularly focused on memory corruption vulnerabilities which are common in C libraries, two of the medium vulnerabilities were categorized as CWE 330 â€“ Use of Insufficiently Random Values.
